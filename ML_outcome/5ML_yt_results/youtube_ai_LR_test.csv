99,believe we are meant to be like jesus in our heart and not in our flesh but be careful of ai for it know only thing of the flesh such a our fleshly desire and cannot comprehend thing of the spirit

spirit never sleep and that is why you have dream unless you have died in peace physically more so true love that endures and last is thing of the heart when say 39 heart 39 mean 39 spirit 39 but fake love pretentious love love with expectation love for classic reason love for material reason love because of material need and love for selfish reason those are thing of the flesh in the beginning god said let u make man in our own image according to our likeness take note god is spirit and god is love a love he is the source of it we also know that god is omnipotent for he creates out of nothing and he ha no beginning and ha no end that mean our love is but shadow of god 39 love true love look around to see who is in need of your help your smile your possession your money your strength your quality time love forgives and forgets love want for others what it want for itself however true love work in conjunction with other spiritual force such a patience and faith in the finished work of our lord and savior jesus christ rather than in what man ha done such a science technology and organization which won 39 last forever to avoid sin and error which lead to the death of your body and your spirit soul in hell fire second death you must make god 39 word the standard for your life not ai if not god will let you face ai on your own with your own strength and it will cast the truth down to the ground it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness we can only destroy ourselves but with god all thing are possible god know u better because he is our creater and he know our beginning and our end the prove text can be found in the book of john 31 44 thessalonian 12 daniel daniel revelation 13 15 matthew 24 25 and luke 21 br br how to make god 39 word the standard for your life br you must read your bible slowly attentively and repeatedly having this in mind that christianity is not religion but love relationship it is measured by the love you have for god and the love you have for your neighbor matthew 13 say quot you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses it flavor how shall it be seasoned it is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men quot our spirit can only be purified while in the body while on earth but after death anything unpurified unclean cannot enter heaven gate blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god matthew no one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten sin make the heart unclean but you can ask god to forgive you to save your soul to cleanse you of your sin to purify your heart by the blood of his son our lord and savior jesus christ which he shed here on earth because isaiah 53 say quot but he wa wounded for our transgression he wa bruised for our iniquity the chastisement for our peace wa upon him and by his stripe we are healed quot meditation in the word of god is visit to god because god is in his word we know god through his word because the word he speaks represent his heart 39 desire meditation is thing of the heart not thing of the mind thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level you think of your problem your trouble but inorder to meditate you must let go of your own will your own desire your own way and let the word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more until the word get into your blood and gain supremacy over you that is when meditation come naturally without forcing yourself turning the word over and over in your heart you can be having conversation with someone while meditating in your heart saying 39 thank you jesus 39 over and over in your heart but it is hard to meditate when you haven 39 let go of offence and past hurt your pain of the past leave it for god don 39 worry yourself jesus is alive you can face tomorrow he understands what you are passing through today begin to meditate on this prayer day and night in all that you do quot lord take more of me and give me more of you give me more of your holiness faithfulness obedience self control purity humility love goodness kindness joy patience forgiveness wisdom understanding calmness perseverance make me channel of shinning light where there is darkness channel of pardon where there is injury channel of love where there is hatred channel of humility where there is pride quot the word of god becomes part of u by meditation not by saying word but spirit prayer prayer from the heart take note god is spirit and those who worship him should do so in spirit and truth genuinely by living the word when the word becomes part of you it will by it very nature influence your conduct and behavior your bad habit you will no longer have the urge to do them you will think differently dream differently act differently and talk differently if something doe not qualify for meditation it doe not qualify for conversation br br the battle between light and darkness good and evil br heaven is god 39 throne and the dwelling place for god 39 angel and the saint hell wa meant for the devil satan and the fallen angel those who torture the soul in hell are demon unclean spirit man 39 spirit is free moral agent you can either yield yourself to god or to the devil because god ha given u discretion if one think he posse only his own spirit he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark god is light while the devil is darkness light holy spirit and darkness evil spirit cannot stay together in man 39 body god is love love is light and where there is no love is hell just a where there is no light is darkness the one you yield yourself to you will get his reward the reward of righteousness to man 39 spirit is life abundant life and the reward of sin to man 39 spirit is death sin and satan are one and the same whatever sin can cause satan also can cause sin is what give the devil dominion or power over man 39 spirit when god 39 word becomes part of you sin power over you is broken you become the righteousness of god through christ jesus where jesus is you are and when he went to the father you went in the book of john 42 47 jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for proceeded forth and came from god nor have come of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech because you are not able to listen to my word you are of your father the devil and the desire of your father you want to do he wa murderer from the beginning and doe not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks lie he speaks from his own resource for he is liar and the father of it which of you convict me of sin and if tell the truth why do you not believe me he who is of god hears god word therefore you do not hear because you are not of god my prayer is quot may god bless his word in the midst of your heart quot glory and honour be to god our father our lord and savior jesus christ and our helper the holy spirit watch and pray thank you for your time and may god bless you a you share this message with others ,Positive

255,believe we are meant to be like jesus in our heart and not in our flesh but be careful of ai for it know only thing of the flesh such a our fleshly desire and cannot comprehend thing of the spirit such a true love and eternal joy that come from obeying god 39 word man is spirit and ha soul but life in body which is flesh when you go to bed it is the flesh that sleep but your spirit never sleep and that is why you have dream unless you have died in peace physically more so true love that endures and last is thing of the heart when say 39 heart 39 mean 39 spirit 39 but fake love pretentious love love with expectation love for classic reason love for material reason and love for selfish reason those are thing of the flesh in the beginning god said let u make man in our own image according to our likeness take note god is spirit and god is love a love he is the source of it we also know that god is omnipotent for he creates out of nothing and he ha no beginning and ha no end that mean our love is but shadow of god 39 love true love look around to see who is in need of your help your smile your possession your money your strength your quality time love forgives and forgets love want for others what it want for itself however true love work in conjunction with other spiritual force such a patience and faith in the finished work of our lord and savior jesus christ rather than in what man ha done such a science technology and organization which won 39 last forever to avoid sin and error which lead to the death of your body and your spirit soul in hell fire second death you must make god 39 word the standard for your life not ai if not god will let you face ai on your own with your own strength and it will cast the truth down to the ground it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness we can only destroy ourselves but with god all thing are possible god know u better because he is our creater and he know our beginning and our end the prove text can be found in the book of john 31 44 thessalonian 12 daniel daniel revelation 13 15 matthew 24 25 and luke 21 br br how to make god 39 word the standard for your life br you must read your bible slowly attentively and repeatedly having this in mind that christianity is not religion but love relationship it is measured by the love you have for god and the love you have for your neighbor matthew 13 say quot you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses it flavor how shall it be seasoned it is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men quot our spirit can only be purified while in the body while on earth but after death anything unpurified unclean cannot enter heaven gate blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god matthew no one in his right mind can risk or even bare to put anything rotten into his body nor put the rotten thing closer to the those which are not rotten sin make the heart unclean but you can ask god to forgive you to save your soul to cleanse you of your sin to purify your heart by the blood of his son our lord and savior jesus christ which he shed here on earth because isaiah 53 say quot but he wa wounded for our transgression he wa bruised for our iniquity the chastisement for our peace wa upon him and by his stripe we are healed quot meditation in the word of god is visit to god because god is in his word we know god through his word because the word he speaks represent his heart 39 desire meditation is thing of the heart not thing of the mind thinking is lower level while meditation is upper level you think of your problem your trouble but inorder to meditate you must let go of your own will your own desire your own way and let the word you read prevail over thinking process by thinking of it more and more until the word get into your blood and gain supremacy over you that is when meditation come naturally without forcing yourself turning the word over and over in your heart you can be having conversation with someone while meditating in your heart saying 39 thank you jesus 39 over and over in your heart but it is hard to meditate when you haven 39 let go of offence and past hurt your pain of the past leave it for god don 39 worry yourself jesus is alive you can face tomorrow he understands what you are passing through today begin to meditate on this prayer day and night in all that you do quot lord take more of me and give me more of you give me more of your holiness faithfulness obedience self control purity humility love goodness kindness joy patience forgiveness wisdom understanding calmness perseverance make me channel of shinning light where there is darkness channel of pardon where there is injury channel of love where there is hatred channel of humility where there is pride quot the word of god becomes part of u by meditation not by saying word but spirit prayer prayer from the heart when the word becomes part of you it will by it very nature influence your conduct and behavior your bad habit you will no longer have the urge to do them you will think differently dream differently act differently and talk differently if something doe not qualify for meditation it doe not qualify for conversation br br the battle between light and darkness good and evil br heaven is god 39 throne and the dwelling place for god 39 angel and the saint hell wa meant for the devil satan and the fallen angel those who torture the soul in hell are demon unclean spirit man 39 spirit is free moral agent you can either yield yourself to god or to the devil because god ha given u discretion if one think he posse only his own spirit he is lying to himself and he is already in the dark god is light while the devil is darkness light holy spirit and darkness evil spirit cannot stay together in man 39 body god is love love is light and where there is no love is hell just a where there is no light is darkness the one you yield yourself to you will get his reward the reward of righteousness to man 39 spirit is life abundant life and the reward of sin to man 39 spirit is death sin and satan are one and the same whatever sin can cause satan also can cause sin is what give the devil dominion or power over man 39 spirit when god 39 word becomes part of you sin power over you is broken you become the righteousness of god through christ jesus where jesus is you are and when he went to the father you went in the book of john 42 47 jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for proceeded forth and came from god nor have come of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech because you are not able to listen to my word you are of your father the devil and the desire of your father you want to do he wa murderer from the beginning and doe not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks lie he speaks from his own resource for he is liar and the father of it which of you convict me of sin and if tell the truth why do you not believe me he who is of god hears god word therefore you do not hear because you are not of god my prayer is quot may god bless his word in the midst of your heart quot glory and honour be to god our father our lord and savior jesus christ and our helper the holy spirit watch and pray thank you for your time and may god bless you a you share this message with others ,Positive

624,many of these ai chatbots say directly in their term of service that they cannot be used for commercial purpose unless you have license with them despite the fact that their datasets include copyrighted and protected material that they themselves are indirectly monetizing br br some profession will be assisted and enhanced by ai and others could be replaced altogether what ai can do is operate in the real material world so it mostly academic and creative field that will change and that change could lead to more opportunity or limit opportunity for work ,Negative
625,for me this development of ai art and whatever mean the end of open source site br we are going to see lot of copywrite law start to form on the internet where company who want to create this ai using existing information on the internet is going to have to pay some large amount of cash to use the information or art or whatever to be used br br this is basically the end of free internet everything might cost money from now on ,Negative
626,this is very much like rich people saying quot money doesn 39 buy happiness quot and attractive people saying quot look don 39 matter quot ,Positive
627,good marketing is about what stand out that make it hard to automate by default ,Positive
628,take this a change is inevitable so no matter how much we hate something we have to adapt and keep moving or accept our fate suck that this exists but we ll have to learn about it to grow suppose ,Negative
629,let 39 appreciate the footage on href URL where woman sits in front of imac unplugged to the power cable ,Positive
630,have another quote for you it 39 called quot feeding the aligator quot keep feeding it information and skill and one day it 39 going to eat you too br mean why not maybe you get sick and can 39 give me good advice anymore will just hire the ai instead of the original ,Positive
631,the bear analogy sum it all up excelent metaphor ,Positive
632,hey chris do team love the video br wa hoping to get some advice if that 39 sound with you br br so have this client 39 ve been trying to work with for couple month now br br they recognize the value in what we are offering to them and they 39 ve personally used our product a we have gifted them multiple time out of good will of course br br can safely say we provided value first and showed them how we can be of value to them br br but they just won 39 decide to buy or not 39 regularly checking in and asking question hoping it will lead to answer but no sir they don 39 give u the time of day br br so what do you recommend amp how would you diagnose this problem ,Positive
633,and it crazy the feeling the chill the urgency the passion integrity empowering crazy so happy saw your channel ,Positive
634,wa hired to consult vega mastermind last month to help the room better digest amp implement what they be learning via hypnotherapy my colleague showed me an example of what he wanted me to do by asking chatgpt to draft sample hypnotherapy session while wa impressed realized it only knew how to create basic hypnosis script so while ai can be effective for various creative job it still in it infancy amp seems to serve more so a decent blueprint drafter than final product creator br br there also human element that something like chatgpt simply lack that actually enabled me to tweak and improve the effectiveness of my hypnosis in the moment is it effective yes to degree however unless creative completely lack imagination have some faith they ll be ok for while ,Positive
635,love those soft big square throw mics and uncle chris ,Positive
636,amazing stuff chris EMOJIsmile ,Positive
637,this just blew my mind ,Positive
638,thank you for this ,Positive
639,didn 39 understand what you mean in brief ,Positive
640,awesome video ,Positive
641,quot the future tent to reward first mover quot not really think you should try your best to be on the fore front but also observe those in front of you and see what mistake they make facebook wasn 39 the first social platform google wasn 39 the first search engine apple wasn 39 the first to make smart phone ,Positive
642,how is it democratization if some can get left behind ,Negative
643,the dobot can 39 wait for that ,Positive
644,the last analogy is chilling but unfortunately true am optimistic ai chat bot won 39 replace much of the workforce a it is overrated at least in it current direction it might help improve work efficiently by 10 20 but it is still very limited to be comparable to human much like calculator or even spreadsheet did not replace accountant am sure in those day someone would have said they would but they did not ,Negative
645,quite insightful however don 39 think mr do quite understands the position of the entry level designer who just entered the market he 39 big shot he probably won 39 even feel the aftermath of this whole thing ,Negative
646,this so good ,Positive
647,so the answer is yes it is the end unless you have the resource to make an ai that other people will use to accelerate the getting to the end state sooner ,Positive
648,this reinforces the need to wider range of skill specially the so called soft skill the best designer in the world still need to sell their service to the world at least in the beginning br br ai doesn 39 change that you can good work faster but it doesn 39 matter if no one know ,Negative
649,this part of why in general 39 retraining to do something unrelated to and well away from design something more practical and long term wheras in design have to seemingly keep reinventing myself every year desperately trying to keep up with new trend tech and younger mind br br it 39 not so much ai now that worry me it 39 what it 39 ll be like in 10 15 20 year ,Positive
650,the question is where are business people turning to ai instead of dealing with creatives one answer could be that business people could pivot project quicker if dealing with licensed work ,Negative
651,please see the adam conover interview with timnit gebru and emily bender for more information and context on the matter ,Positive
652,omg quotEMOJIwinkobot quot that is epic ,Positive
653,end them no take lot of work away from human artist yes ,Negative
654,there 39 still hope for even the slowest person because some people stick their head in the sand hoping the bear will go away they get eaten first lol think we need to see a tool learn how to wield it it 39 the same a when photography wa invented then came photoshop then came the internet etc will change lot of thing but it won 39 destroy everything ,Positive
655,chat don 39 kill my job or whatever kendrick lamar said ,Negative
656,ai is the bear don be the slowest person love it ,Positive
657,decade ago 39 tut plus 39 website came out teaching people how to create magical effect with photoshop people were complaining quot now regular people will be able to design their own stuff quot exactly so are you just extorting my skill gap or are you truly adding an extension of vision and possibility ,Positive
658,honestly this ai is going to destroy lot of job and not just in the creative industry ,Positive
659,if you are an artist with very unique design art identity own that trademark that copyright that or what ever law needed to protect you and your art from being stolen or used without permission and that 39 the only way you will be protected against this ai company ,Positive
660,well in gaming there is term for those using ai to be assisted ,Positive
661,wa laid off my corp video editing and motion graphic job last week ,Negative
662,,Positive
663,hope it will not happen because of creative thinking br ai is not able to think creative we use the ai and build more advance thing ,Negative
664,excellent metaphor 39 so grateful that you sharing such amazing content with u ,Positive
665,dang that guy asking the question is really handsome ,Negative
666,short answer is yes that why this dude is trying to be the new opra ,Positive
667,it could be threat graphic designer when man tres to design something who need brain storm which mean need element for thinking out of box the logic of this process is right same on what ai did ,Negative
668,yeah yeah thats why take me too much time til realize everything even you have your robort with no clear goal you still be at the bottom ,Negative
669,yes yes amp yes ,Positive
670,chris nailed this ,Positive
671,ai weiwei said something interesting art that can be easily copied by ai is meaningless ,Positive
672,always loved his optimistic nature but what he said in this video wa really poorly thought out br lot of people are forcing themselves to adopt ai into their workflow because of the uncertainty the technology brings and the fear of being left behind br wish people would think le logically and follow their heart little more especially creative people ,Negative
673,don 39 delete this video and let see what he saying in year ,Positive
674,for instant art chatgpt will take over it but not for creative art ,Negative
675,pragmatic ,Positive
676,do graphic designer not have passion project that you do on your own time that have no monetary incentive think if you don 39 have this type of work a foundation of your practice you are already the ai ,Positive
677,okay so need to carry fish if see bear chasing me ,Negative
678,we need also more real intelligence ,Positive
679,when you have clear goal you magnetize yourself the mean and the method will materialize ,Positive
680,bah client will always need help there will always be people willing to pay someone else to do work even if alexa can do there will always be wall that alexa need help getting over it you know wa once directory assistance operator that job is gone but that is okay it wa crap job guess my point is that the world is constantly changing and in way that aren 39 always going to be predictable but that 39 okay change can be good don 39 fear the change just embrace learning and evolving and if you can do that then you will always be adaptable and survive ,Positive
681,check out sora it fresh and spooky ,Positive
682,rather than the bear analogy prefer the one with the horse and you 39 ve got to ride it you won 39 outrun it but the last question from the art director lady wa relevant because humanity is constantly building the world for it 39 own purpose so we have to do it with caution like with global warming why would you care if you thought 39 ll die anyway it leave it for the next gen it 39 the same here if the ai will be art director then what 39 next there will be only corporation left run by ai you better think of it now before it 39 too late and we are all fkd are we really sure we want to go this rounte now is the time to think this through and maybe stop it think ai should not be in 100 public domain and should be banned from most of activity it should be prohibited in area where it is not needed and could potentially cause too much lost profession like art for example it should be used for medical purpose of course the answer is not easy but the way it ha been nonchalantly deployed now into the wild by bunch of people who gave them the right to make this decision they did use all the data available not asking anyone ,Positive
683,at the first glance ai generated image are cool and stunning but they don 39 have meaningful message in them and they do not give u an emotional impact because robot are not human would say yes ai can take over job focus on repetition task so designer can have more time to focus on the creative part ,Negative
684,don be the slowest person ,Positive
685,ai jobloss this won end well can we please ceaseai gpt or at least consider pausingai ,Negative
686,okay totally agree with mr chris and that is yes one day day will takeover job of all creative job it 39 didn 39 cost learning something new and growing even right now 39 learning drawing for child book illustration and comic book artist a well a graphic design even my mentor who guide me about drawing he even tell me the same thing that chirs say in this video br br and if you ask me do we need to scared of then my answer will no but why because all is built to work with u a tool even it make wonderful logo it doesn 39 have emotion to understand psychology behind emotion and brand so no will work with u a tool ,Positive
687,want robot of me ,Negative
688,the ai is not gonna be one small bear who will eat single slowest designer it 39 more like massive army of ai bear who will take out the majority of low end or even mid level artist ,Negative
689,another famous creative guy sold ,Positive
690,ai simply cannot be creative it will only output what it ha been inputted with essentially in order for an ai to output something creative it need creative input br href URL this is essentially what im talking about ,Positive
691,think of how terrified portrait artist must have been of photographer quot you can do what take me week in single flash and all you have to do is point and press that button protrusion quot ,Positive
692,this is winning attitude ,Positive
693,love this channel but not sure about this video it lack empathy a it 39 defined in the ux world br br it 39 hard for new design folk and will probably become harder the one that have already been in the game for decade plus have already their network have already made it like chris yes those ai tool will make them more productive br br but how is it for folk who just finished uni or design bootcamp and are now trying to find some entry level job can see fewer level entry job being available a mid to senior design folk will be more productive using these ai tool hope 39 wrong br br also the metaphor of ai being the bear why do we have to invoke image of death that some folk will be eaten and perpetuate the zero sum game model br br rather we should look at our current system and re design it so it meet the need or our society and people living in it and not move close to elysium br br know it 39 not chris 39 job to redesign the system EMOJIwink ,Negative
694,yes and no it tool so many professional with weak skill will be steamrolled because it great tool for prototyping and conceptual art so skilled professional will still be needed to finalize it ,Positive
695,my biggest issue a creative working in the social medium era is the scale of the project want to undertake they take long time to see through without having the resource available of wider team br br what 39 finding now is no longer need to browse endless tutorial and webpage to find the information need to progress chatgpt will give me what need and even help me understand why need it to solve specific problem br br allowing me to focus on the aspect enjoy like mapping the overall vision br br really exciting time 39 developing at much quicker rate thanks to these tool ,Negative
696,will ai end creative profession the real answer is that nobody know not even you ,Negative
697,chris do never completely resonates with me a he never understands the position of privilege he ha ,Negative

703,he solved nothing with this video ,Positive
704,chatgpt open ai claude and all of the other similar model popping up are not true ai they are language model llm br br they don 39 posse true intelligence though they can appear to act intelligently still they 39 re not actually artificial general intelligence agi br br instead chatgpt serf the same purpose a calculator it may be an advanced and sophisticated technology but at it core it still just function a word calculator br br but instead of calculating number chatgpt calculates the next word phrase code based on the data they have access to the internet br br a creatives our prompt the more detailed the better are key in getting large language model llm to make good content thats because llm are unable to actually understand the meaning of the text they are scanning instead they re just parroting out calculated phrase based on the parameter we gave it aka prompt br br the more detailed your prompt the better the llm output br br basically this so called ai is simply digital tool than an actual true artificial intelligence br br using chatgpt is more like human wearing robotic arm prosthetic than something out of robot it simply augments creativity the same way prosthetic arm augments human movement br br one day someone will create an actual agi that sits on top of llm that will be the true ai breakthrough br br but chatgpt it simply tool fantastic tool but tool none the le ,Positive
705,btu funny video though ,Positive
706,very funny quotEMOJIwinkesigner quot talking about creativity whereas post only bussiness customer and money video ,Positive
707,hope it doe so that human can move on to something more real in life ,Positive
